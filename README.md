Memory Game:

In order to play again you currently have to refresh the webpage. I'm going to add a replay button later and possibly an online highscore board. For now, you can play the game alone.

How to play: 
Click a square, then click another square. If the two share the same picture, you'll get some points. If not, you'll lose some. Keep flipping cards until you've flipped them all!

Note: This includes anime. It's not a very professional program, but I still spent a lot of time writing the code for it. It's an excellent example of basic react skills.

Missing Features:
- Play Again Button
- Highscores
- Better UI
- Custom Art
